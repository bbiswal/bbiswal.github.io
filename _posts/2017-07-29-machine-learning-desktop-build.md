summary:    For my machine learning applications, I thought it'd be best to have a dedicated desktop running Ubuntu.

For my machine learning applications, I knew I could save a lot of time if I had a powerful desktop dedicated to training models.  I chose Ubuntu as my OS because most of the machine learning frameworks like CNTK and Tensorflow have dedicated images or install instructions for Ubuntu.

Microsoft and Google do offer CNTK and Tensorflow as cloud services, but it didn't make sense to use them for development purposes due to the high expense.

After researching parts, I've purchased the following components for my Ubuntu 16.04 machine learning desktop:

* Case: Fractal Design Define C
* CPU: Intel i7-7700K Quad-Core 4.2GHz
* Cooler: Noctua NH-U12S CPU Cooler
* Graphics: EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 SC2
* Memory: HyperX FURY Black 16GB Kit
* Motherboard: GIGABYTE GA-Z270XP-SLI
* Power Supply: Corsair RMx Series, RM850x
* SSD: ADATA SU800 128GB

I decided to go with a SLI motherboard and a large power supply in case I wanted to add a second graphics card.  

The relatively small stock fundamental data sets I plan to use will probably see the most performance gain with the CPU.  It may not see much of a speed up with the powerful 1080 graphics card, so I may resell it on ebay and downgrade to a cheaper one.

Interestingly, it was very difficult finding a graphics card on Amazon and Newegg.  Cryptocurrency miners were buying up many of the Nvidia graphics cards, causing many online stores to be out of stock.
