Welcome to my blog!  I created this blog on the free GitHub pages using the wonderfully simple [Pixyll](https://github.com/johno/pixyll) Jekyll theme.  Setting up the blog is pretty simple - just clone the Pixyll repo and run `bundle install` to install the necessary Ruby gems.  Afterwards, start adding posts in the `_posts` directory.  More information is available on the [Pixyll](https://github.com/johno/pixyll) site.
