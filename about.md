Hello!  My name is __Bobby Biswal__ and I use this blog to share my thoughts and ideas around technology and product development.

One of my favorite quotes is by Tony Hsieh, founder of Zappos:

>Without concious and deliberate effort, inertia always wins.

I named this blog __inercial__ (spanish for "inertial") to remind me to always get off the couch, learn new things, stay productive and explore the world.

Hopefully you'll find something here useful for your own interests or projects.  Thanks for visiting!
